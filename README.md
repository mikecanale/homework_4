# homework_4
So I feel better about this one than the last one in that I at least got some things to function. My start button functions and started my questions. I could click an answer on my question which would start the next question (I have an alert up with RIGHT or WRONG, because I couldn't figure out how to do it any other way -- also I thought I could add seconds with ++ and subtract seconds with -- but that didn't work). I was also unable to get a score at the end, which was disappointing to me. Again, i'm happy I got part of it working, but I'm still feeling pretty far off the whole assignment.
